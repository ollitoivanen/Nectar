# Nectar - a journal app

**This code isn't maintained, used only to showcase code**

## What it does

Nectar is built around the idea of saving images, videos, songs and messages into a feed. This app has an in-built camera interface, Spotify log-in to use Spotify APIs and the ability to pick images from your gallery.

This project only works for android as it has native modules built with Java.
